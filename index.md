## About

I am a research associate and adjunct instructor at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. I use population and quantitative genetics methods to study plant evolution. Currently, I'm using whole genome sequencing data to elucidate adaptive genetic variation in the immperiled tree species, American chestnut (_Castanea dentata_) and chinquapin (_Castanea pumila_ sensu lato). Previously, I worked as a lab manager for Dr. Jeff Ross-Ibarra at the University of California, Davis, where we studied the evolutionary genetics of adaptation and migration in maize (corn) and its wild relative, teosinte.
